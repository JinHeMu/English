**revise**: The cartoons present a thought-provoking scene. In the left drawing, a father is lying on the sofa, watching television, and scolding his son, **who is doing his homework**, saying, “You must learn!” However, in the right drawing, the father is doing homework alongside his son. The purpose of the drawing seems to remind us that it is important for parents to set a good example.
